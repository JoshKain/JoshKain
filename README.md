# ðŸ¤“ Hey, Iâ€™m Joshua Kain...

I'm a full-stack competent Developer with 4 years of experience in the coding world. 
My journey began with a coding course called Northcoders. They introduced me to the matrix and I've been hooked ever since. 
I've made many mistakes, learned loads, and have continued to progress. One of my biggest mistakes was not creating a portfolio, and doing my own projects on the side. I hope you enjoy the adventures I go on.
